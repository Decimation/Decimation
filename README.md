I research the .NET CLR and its internal functionality. I have written some short essays on how the CLR operates which you can see [here](https://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=13568863). 

- [Creating a special pointer type](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1254502/Creating-a-pointer-type-in-Csharp)
- [Determining managed object layout](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1257186/Determining-Object-Layout-using-FieldDescs)
- [Calculating managed object heap size](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1254217/Calculating-Heap-Size-of-Managed-Objects)

Some of my work on analyzing the .NET CLR and implementing/accessing features that are usually forbidden:

I enjoy researching and working with low-level components such as memory, machine architecture, OS design, and so on. I sometimes work on "hacky" projects that tinker with hidden/low-level functionality.
