# Low-level Research

I enjoy researching and working with low-level components such as memory, machine architecture, OS design, and so on. I sometimes work on "hacky" projects that tinker with hidden/low-level functionality. For example, you can see some of my work on subverting the .NET CLR and implementing/accessing features that are usually forbidden:

# TI Calculators

I have done some research and projects on Texas Instruments calculators, specifically the TI-84 Plus CE and the TI-Nspire calculators.
